# Qorzen Oxide

A high-performance, modular plugin-based system built in Rust with comprehensive async core managers and type-safe architecture.

## Features

### Core System Managers

- **Configuration Management**: Type-safe configuration with hot-reloading, environment variable overrides, and validation
- **Event System**: High-performance pub/sub event bus with filtering, backpressure handling, and async event handlers
- **Logging**: Structured logging with multiple outputs, log rotation, and performance monitoring
- **Task Management**: Async task execution with progress tracking, priorities, cancellation, and resource management
- **File Management**: Safe concurrent file operations with locking, integrity checking, and backup capabilities
- **Concurrency Management**: Advanced thread pool management with work stealing and async coordination
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error management with context, severity levels, and recovery strategies

### Architecture Highlights

- **Type Safety**: Extensive use of Rust's type system to prevent runtime errors
- **Async-First**: Built from the ground up for async/await with proper error handling
- **Plugin System**: Modular architecture supporting hot-pluggable components
- **Resource Management**: Automatic cleanup and proper resource lifecycle management
- **Monitoring**: Built-in health checks, metrics, and observability
- **Production Ready**: Comprehensive testing, error handling, and documentation
