- **Rust 1.70+** installed via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/)
- **Git** for version control
- A **GitHub account** for submitting contributions
- **Visual Studio Code** with Rust extensions (recommended)

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/QorzenOxide.git
   cd QorzenOxide
   ```

3. **Add the upstream remote**:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/sssolid/QorzenOxide.git
   ```

4. **Install dependencies and build**:
   ```bash
   cargo build
   ```

5. **Run tests** to ensure everything works:
   ```bash
   cargo test
   ```

6. **Install development tools**:
   ```bash
   # For WASM builds
   cargo install trunk
   
   # For formatting and linting
   rustup component add rustfmt clippy
   ```

### Development Workflow

1. **Create a feature branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following our coding standards
3. **Test your changes** thoroughly:
   ```bash
   # Run all tests
   cargo test
   
   # Run tests for specific platform
   cargo test --features desktop
   cargo test --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
   
   # Run clippy for linting
   cargo clippy --all-features -- -D warnings
   
   # Format code
   cargo fmt
   ```

4. **Commit your changes** with a descriptive message:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add awesome new feature"
   ```

5. **Push to your fork**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

6. **Create a Pull Request** on GitHub

## üìù Coding Standards

### Rust Code Guidelines

- **Follow Rust conventions**: Use `snake_case` for functions and variables, `PascalCase` for types
- **Add documentation**: All public items must have `///` documentation comments
- **Handle errors properly**: Use `Result<T, E>` and the `?` operator, avoid `.unwrap()` except in tests
- **Write safe code**: No `unsafe` blocks without thorough justification
- **Use meaningful names**: Variables and functions should be self-documenting
- **Keep functions small**: Aim for functions that do one thing well

### Code Formatting

We use standard Rust formatting tools:

```bash
# Format all code
cargo fmt

# Check formatting without making changes
cargo fmt -- --check
```

### Linting

All code must pass Clippy without warnings:

```bash
# Run clippy
cargo clippy --all-features -- -D warnings

# Fix automatic linting issues
cargo clippy --fix --all-features
```

### Documentation

- **Public APIs**: Must have comprehensive `///` documentation
- **Examples**: Include usage examples in documentation when helpful
- **Comments**: Use `//` for implementation comments, `///` for public documentation
- **README updates**: Update relevant documentation when adding features

### Testing

- **Unit tests**: Add `#[cfg(test)]` modules for unit tests
- **Integration tests**: Add integration tests in the `tests/` directory when appropriate
- **Cross-platform tests**: Ensure tests work on all supported platforms
- **Test coverage**: Aim for good test coverage of new functionality

## üêõ Reporting Bugs
